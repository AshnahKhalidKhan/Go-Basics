The program must be submitted into a .zip file. The structure of the program should be as follows:

lab3Task

displaypackage

display.goÃ‚Â //Displaying the information submitted

storagepackage

files.go //Opening, Storing file

go.mod //module

main.go //main file for taking input from console/arguments

Ã‚Â 

1. Create a program in GoLang that takes input information from the arguments/console and save the argument into a CSV and a Text file. The data structure for the argument/informationÃ‚Â must be either "map" or "struct."Ã‚Â The information from the user should be:

Name
ERP#
Class
Program
Course
CGPA
Age
Bio
Height
Weight
Gender
Religion
University
City
Country
The program should also print the total time consumed for saving the information into CSV and Text files separately.

The time calculation can be done using time.Now().
