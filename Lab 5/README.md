1. Create a simple module in go in which two threads read a single text with some text, split the text into four parts with 25% of the total text in each part,Â and store the data into four separate files (text files) in Four different threads.

2. Create a simple module in go in which two threads read a single text with some text, split the text into four parts with 25% of the total text in each part,Â and store the data into four separate files (text files) in TwoÂ different threads.Â 

3. Create a simple program in go that takes a valueÂ from the console (lat east greater than 1000) and then performs a Fibonacci calculation on each number from the value in their respective threads and prints the value on the console. Like

Input value: 3456

So there must run four threads, T1, T2, T3, and T4, and each number should be passed to only a single thread, like 3 to T1, 4 to T2, 5 to T3, 6 to T4

4. Write a program in go that takes a value from the console and, then decreases the value up to its 75%Â  prints the value after each successive decrement, and closes out the thread.
